# Fewd-project

This project is a pratice of Brad Travery's Edgeledger project. 
I learnt the use of flexbox, how to wor with api, although i could not get it to work due to billing issues on the website. 
I also learnt website responsiveness with the use of flexbox and media queries.

This project is open to further modification, especially the google map api(read the comments in the markup)
